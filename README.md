<p>
In this step we pretend we are a worker for a business and submit a ticket to our help desk. We use a fake name and email, and proceed to give the details of our issue. We also select the type of problem pertaining to our ticket.

</p>
<p>
In this second step we login to our helpdesk as Admin John Doe, and proceed to assign this ticket to our admin Jane after determining the type of ticket it is. Of course, before assigning to her admin John leaves notes about the ticket, for Jane to read.

</p>
<p>
In this final step, Jane logs in, and reviews the notes John left. She leaves a comment about her thoughts on what may be causing the issue. Afterwards she goes on to review the problem and troubleshoot accordingly. After she solves the problem, she proceeds to comment her final thoughts about the ticket and that it has been resolved, she then selects resolve ticket and changes the ticket status.
